# Streamlit_African_food_prices
Streamlit is an app that shows an analysis of various African food prices.
In the datasets originally the food prices were given in diffrent african contries local currnecy, so i used "MS EXCEL VLOOKUP/XLOOKUP OPTION" to convert the prices to a common currency which is Dollar (USD), you can see that in the excel file i uploaded, also i used Text(Date...) to convert from month number to month name.
to run the app follow the following steps:
make sure you have installled all required library for the pip list
Run CMD on your system
copy the program folder directory and use cd to move into the folder
use cd to move into venv folder
use cd to move into scripts
then type activate to run the virtual enviroment
you move from the scripts folder to the project folder by us double step back i.e cd ../../
you then run your app with "streamlit run project.py"
